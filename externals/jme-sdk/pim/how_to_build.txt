Component Building HOW-TO
--------------------------

This file contains the instructions to build the source code provided with the zip package of the Java
client SDK (these same instructions apply if the code is downloaded via SVN).

Currently this package builds on the following platforms:

1. Java MircoEdition (MIDP 2.0)
2. BlackBerry (OS >= 4.2.1)
3. Java SE (Java >= 1.1)
4. Android

--------------------------
System Requirements
--------------------------

The system requirements depend on the target platform. The following ones are common to all platforms, while below
there are the platform specific ones.

    For all platforms:
    - Download and install Apache Ant: http://ant.apache.org/ (version 1.7 is required)

    For Java Micro Edition:
    - Download and install Sun Java Wireless Toolkit: http://java.sun.com/products/sjwtoolkit/ (recommended version 2.5.2)
    - Download and install Apache Antenna: http://antenna.sourceforge.net/ (recommended version 1.0.2)

    For BlackBerry:
    - Download and install Sun Java Wireless Toolkit: http://java.sun.com/products/sjwtoolkit/ (recommended version 2.5.2)
    - Download and install Apache Antenna: http://antenna.sourceforge.net/ (recommended version 1.0.2)

    For Java Standard Edition:
    No additional requirements

    For Android:
    - Download and install the Android SDK: http://developer.android.com/sdk/1.5_r2/index.html

--------------------------
Configuring the APIs
--------------------------

1. Unzip the package into your working directory
2. Open (create if needed) a build.properties file in ~/funambol/build/<platform>/
   (where platform is: me for Java MicroEdition
                       bb for BlackBerry
                       se for Java StandardEdition
                       android for Android)
   [the symbol '~' refers to the user home directory. On Windows system this is generally "Documents and Settings/<user>".
    See the Java home.user variable for more details]

The set of settings to apply depends on the platform.

3.a For Java Micro Edition:
    - WTK home on your environment
      wtk.home=<wtk-home>
      Example: wtk.home=C:/wtk2.5.2
    - The Javacc home dir
      Example: javacchome=C:/javacc-4.0

3.b For BlackBerry:
    - Same settings as Java MicroEdition
    - The Blackeberry JDE home dir is required to build the API for BlackBerry; they are compliant with the API provided by RIM:
      bb.jdehome=<BB jde home dir>
      Example: bb.jdehome=C:/tools/Research In Motion/Blackberry JDE 4.2.1
    - The Javacc home dir
      Example: javacchome=C:/javacc-4.0

3.c For Java Standard Edition
    - The Javacc home dir
      Example: javacchome=C:/javacc-4.0


3.d For Android
    - The Android SDK home dir is required
      sdk-folder=<Android SDK>
    - The Javacc home dir
      Example: javacchome=C:/javacc-4.0

--------------------------
Building the source
--------------------------

1. Open a shell and go to the directory pim/build/<platform>
2. The "ant usage" command shows the list of available targets
3. Type "ant build" to build
4. The build process generates the required jar file for the built component into the directory pim/output/<platform>

In case of any problems with the build process, access the Funambol Community Forge Project  following this link: https://core.forge.funambol.org and contact Funambol for support.
